# Lab Report 5: My Favorite Lab (Lab 2)

Lab 2 took us through using Github Desktop and building a server.

## Github Desktop

I really loved the fact that we were given Github desktop. My first few quarters with CS, I really wished there was a better, and faster way to transfer
code from my laptop to my home PC. I was forced with using the website version of Github to push changes and pull them from there, which ultimately led to
me forgetting to push changes, leaving myself stranded outside with empty/old code.

Github Desktop changed that for me. It recorded changes live, even to files added and removed. It made things much easier and streamlined to commit and 
push changes. It made things easy to throw into my routine and ensured I didn't forget to commit any changes. And ultimately, the interface is just very
nice and pleasant to look at and use.

## Creating a Local Website

This was also one of my favorite parts of CSE15l. I think with many of the programs we code in CSE11 and 12, they are mainly just programs that you run 
locally. Yes, the websites we created only worked locally, but when we created the websites, it felt like I was actually creating something tangible.
Especially when we used the remote server to be able to SHARE our websites that we created with our classmates.

### The Process

Going through this lab was fairly straightforward. It was an earlier lab, with simpler tasks, and few debugging.

I think I definitely struggled a bit with being familiar with the syntax of the Server stuff. Like the search queries and the sort. Since the Server.java
files were given to us, it definitely didn't require us to learn much about Java Servers. I think if I were to go back to understand them more, I'd like to
have done research on the commands and syntax of Java Servers. Even to this day, I am not fully familiar with the Server methods. I just copied the contents
from the original Server.java files in the following labs that required to create a Server again.

Ideally, I'd want to be able to construct a server myself. With that level of confidence, I could be more comfortable in Java.
